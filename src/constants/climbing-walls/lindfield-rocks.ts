  description:
    "Highly popular, historic bouldering destination. Mostly vertical, with some steeper stuff, some highball, some safe.\nMillions of variations on the described problems exist, and everything's been done. Have fun and explore. \nComments on grades and star ratings are welcomed.\nUseful Info: 'Problems' are described right-to-left. Take care with landings. Most high problems have toprope bolts in place to save erosion and tree damage - use them if you're toproping! If it's damp/sandy, try to stay off to minimise wear.\nProblem selection based on 'Sydney Bouldering', 2001 Peter Balint et al, which you really should buy as a Sydney boulderer.\n",
  approach:
    "Near the corner of Archbold Road and Tryon Road in Lindfield is a small driveway (turn right off Archbold before it becomes Eastern Arterial Road and it's immediately after).\nPark up and follow the trail to the right of the tennis courts for two minutes to the crag. Convenience!\n",
